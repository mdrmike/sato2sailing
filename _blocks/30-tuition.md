Alamitos Bay Yacht Club (ABYC) hosts the local High School Sailing program. Tuition fee is per semester and covers costs of all shared equipment; boats, sails, rigging, maintenance, and boat trailers (for towing to away regattas).

Tuition also covers the cost for a professional coach for practices as well as most regattas, plus use of ABYC facilities to review video and have strategy "chalk talks."  All coaches are US Sailing Level 1 (minimum), AED, CPR, and First Aid certified.
