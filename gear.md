Sailing in warm Southern California weather doesn't require a lot of specialized gear. However, on poor weather days at practice or a regatta, special gear is required to stay warm, typically in the [colder rainy months (Nov-Mar)](https://www.weather-us.com/en/california-usa/long-beach-climate). In winter months, and travel regattas to NorCal year round, its important to have gear to keep warm and dry.

#### Specialized Gear Not Needed (Right Away)

If you're new to sailing, purchasing specialized sailing gear can be a bit overwhelming. The terminology and brands can be confusing. Sailing has the stereotype that it an expensive sport! Don't worry, its no more expensive than other youth sports, and much of the gear lasts longer if its not lost.  Start with **Required Sailing Gear,** the first item or two you may need to purchase, but if you participate in water sports or beach activities, there's a good chance you already have many of the items you need.  Then checkout items on **Inexpensive/Practice Gear.**


<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">

## Required Sailing Gear

1.   **Life jacket** — Must be _US Coast Guard Approved_ Personal Flotation Device (AKA. _USCG Approved PFD_). Be careful not to buy a *buoyancy aid*, or *inflatable life vest*. Neither is acceptable (per ISSA rules). If you're new and unsure of commitment, start with something less expensive. It can always become a backup/practice jacket. Be sure PFD is

1.   **Shoes** — Something that covers toes and can get wet. Old converse or vans are great, sailing or surf booties are ideal for racing and cold weather.

1.   **Sunscreen** — UV is stronger on the water due to both reflected and sometimes magnified sunlight. Choose sunscreen with good UVA protection containing **ecamsule, avobenzone, oxybenzone, titanium dioxide, sulisobenzone, or zinc oxide**. [Even dark skinned sailors](http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/skin-cancer-and-skin-of-color) need to wear sunscreen.

1.   **Sunglasses** — _with UV protection._  A strap/clip is also helpful to ensure they're not lost during a capsize or blown away. Ever see seniors with blue-blocker sun glasses? Avoid eye problems in the future, UV radiation affects skin & eyes over time. Use protection like sunblock & glasses!

1.   **Hat** — For UV protection of face and back of neck. A hat with an attached strap, or a separate clip-on strap. But again, use sunblock. The water reflects UV light even on cloudy days.

1.   **Drinking Water** — Hydration is important. Re-usable water bottles are great. Each coach boat has a jug of water to refill each bottle during practices.

1.   **Watch** — Waterproof watch with countdown timer (this is necessary for all racing sailors)

#### Inexpensive/Practice Gear

You can get by with this gear most of the time in Long Beach.  

-   Workout clothes as base layer (Buy from sale rack, no need to match, they're under other clothes)
-   Old/inexpensive fleece/wool zip-up or pullovers for warmth
-   Waterproof raincoat for splash guard
-   Hands: Gardening Gloves (polyester w/ latex coating) ~$5
-   Feet: Old sneakers that can get wet
-   Synthetic fabrics: Polyester, Lycra, Rayon
-   Natural fabrics: Merino Wool, Bamboo


### When to Buy Gear

Once you have all required gear, create strategies to buy gear _when its on sale,_ or you could spend a small fortune on gear! Start with essentials then expand when things are on sale to keep sailing costs much much lower! :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:  And if you buy quality gear when its on sale, it will still last for years, rather than buying cheaper alternatives!

For many sailing brands/retailers, a popular time of year for sales is during [winter break (on our Calendar)](/calendar/). This is often when old styles are replaced with newer styles. Although, most months you can always find a good deal on a piece of gear. In addition to watching for a sale, consider strategies like [tracking price drops on Amazon](https://www.howtogeek.com/317426/how-to-track-sales-and-price-drops-on-amazon/), etc.



### Cold Weather Sailing Apparel


During the winter months you should plan to invest in some gear to keep warm. Sailing while cold for hours out on the water is not fun! Be prepared! Wearing the right gear allows you to have fun year round. _If you're getting cold while sailing, you aren't wearing the right gear._ Like snow skiing/snowboarding, you need appropriate apparel.

The good news, a lot of gear you need to stay warm in sailing during cold conditions is the same as what you need for other winter sports, like skiing & snowboarding. If you purchase wisely, you'll have gear that can be used for water or snow.  The key is waterproof outer layer, insulation/thick for warmth, and breathable/wicking inner.

### Strategies to Stay Warm

1.  **Base layer:** _Wicks moisture._ A base layer should be specially made to wick moisture away from skin to help stay warm after a capsize or to cool on a hot day; look for clothing designed for this with fabric made from bamboo viscose, merino wool, and synthetic fibers (polyester, spandex, lycra).
1.  **Mid layer:** _Warmth._ Mid layers should also help wick away moisture, but are chosen based on insulation for cold days. These can be separate tops & bottoms, or full body like trousers/salopettes. _Be aware multiple mid-layers can restrict movement._
1.  **Outer layer:** _Waterproof._ Top outer layers are for keeping you dry from water spray/splashing.  
1.  **NO Cotton:** _Cold/wet._ Don't wear cotton underwear/apparel in cold conditions. Cotton is naturally cooling, it absorbs moisture, holds it, and can even become sodden.
1.  **NO Rubber boots:** _Cold/wet._ — Don't wear rubber boots in cold conditions. They don't provide insulation, and your feet will be cold.
1.  **Regatta Strategies:** _Warm/Dry = Fun!_ Stay warm. Stay dry. Bring towels. In case of rain or capsize, bring a full change of gear to change into between race rotations. Hang your wet clothes immediately, they will dry even on rainy days. Fleece/wool blankets can be nice to keep warm when sitting between rotations in team pop-up tent.

##### Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
