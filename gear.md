This the place where you'll find information about the gear you'll need for sailing, plus resources for getting better.

For winter months, its important to have a waterproof splash jacket—durable, lightweight  and waterproof, but not warm. To stay warm buy mid-layers like fleece & wool. Finally, to stay warm in case of capsize, your base layer clothes (including underwear) should be skin tight clothes made of a **water wicking material** like, _bamboo, synthetic blend, or merino wool_.

## Required Sailing Gear

1.   **Drinking Water** — Hydration is important. Re-usable water bottles are great. Each coach boat has a jug of water to refill each bottle during practices.

1.   **Hat** — For UV protection of face and back of neck. A hat with an attached strap, or a separate clip-on strap

1.   **Life jacket** — USCG (US Coast Guard) Approved. Be careful not to buy a *buoyancy aid*, or *inflatable life vests* as neither are allowed (per ISSA rules).

1.   **Shoes** — Something that covers their toes and can get wet. Old converse or vans are great, sailing or surf booties are more ideal for racing and cold weather.

1.   **Sunglasses** — with UV protection.  A strap/clip is also helpful to ensure they're not lost during a capsize or blown away.

1.   **Sunscreen** — UV is stronger on the water due to both reflected and sometimes magnified sunlight. Choose sunscreen with good UVA protection containing **ecamsule, avobenzone, oxybenzone, titanium dioxide, sulisobenzone, or zinc oxide**. [Even dark skinned sailors](http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/skin-cancer-and-skin-of-color) need to wear sunscreen.

1.   **Watch** — Waterproof watch with countdown timer (this is necessary for all racing sailors)


### Sailing Apparel

During the winter months, you should plan to invest in some warm gear. Being cold when you're out on the water is not fun! Being prepared and wearing the right gear allows you to have fun year round. Consider sports such as snow skiing or cold water diving. The key is wearing appropriate gear. If you're cold while sailing, you aren't wearing the right gear.

**Gear Suggestions include:** Foul weather bibs/trousers, smocks, salopettes, neoprene tops/bottoms/wetsuits, sailing booties.  Gill and Zhik are popular for apparel, but that's not an endorsement.  Always choose function over form/brand. Sailing apparel is particularly needed in winter/spring and anytime water is particularly cold, such as NorCal.

#### Layering Strategy to Stay Warm

1.  **Base layer** (wick moisture) — A base layer should be specially made to wick moisture away from skin to help stay warm after a capsize or to cool on a hot day; look for clothing designed for this with materials such as bamboo, merino wool, and synthetic fibers (polyester).
2.  **Mid layer** (Warmth) — Mid layers should also help wick away moisture, but are chosen based on insulation for cold days.
3.  **Outer layer** (Waterproof) — Top outer layers are for keeping you dry from water spray/splashing.  
4.  **Cotton is Cold** (Ha!) — Cottom absorbs moisture and holds it.
