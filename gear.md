This the place where you'll find information about the gear you'll need for sailing, and resources for getting better.

## Required Gear

-   Life jacket (US Coast Guard Approved), NO “BOUYANCY AIDS”
-   Waterproof watch with countdown timer (this is necessary for all racing sailors)
-   Sunscreen and hat
-   Sunglasses with UV protection (preferably with strap/clip)
-   Shoes. Something that covers their toes and can get wet. Old converse or vans are great, sailing or surf booties are more ideal for racing.
-   Re-usable water bottles are great. Each coach boat has a jug of water to refill each bottle during practices.
-   During the winter months, you should plan to invest in some warmer gear. Fleece, beanies, and anything waterproof are a good place to start. Wetsuits are ideal for sailing and warm neoprene or waterproof gloves are a must. 


**Gear Suggestions include:** Foul weather bibs, smocks, salopettes, neoprene tops/bottoms/wetsuits, sailing booties.  Stohlquist "rocker" or Gill and Zhik are popular for apparel, but that's not an endorsement.  Always choose function over form/brand.
