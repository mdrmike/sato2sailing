Sato Sailing **Events Calendar** is based on [:calendar: PCISA Events Schedule](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/schedule-results/current/2019/2020/pcisa-s),  [:calendar: Sato Holidays](https://sato-lbusd-ca.schoolloop.com/calendar), and Practice schedule at Alamitos Bay Yacht Club (ABYC). In addition, we've included other 💡 non-highschool sailing regattas and clinics from the [:calendar: SCYYRA calendar](http://www.scyyra.org/calendar/2019), with the goal is to help inform and encourage our sailors of additional regattas they could sail.
