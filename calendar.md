Sailing practice is typically Wednesday and Friday's @3:00p until 6:00p (or later). üå¨Ô∏è‚õµ Practice days are on our calendar below.

Our **Events Calendar** is based on [:calendar: PCISA Events Schedule](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/schedule-results/current/2019/2020/pcisa-s) for 2019-20 and [:calendar: Sato Holidays](https://sato-lbusd-ca.schoolloop.com/calendar). In addition, we've included other üí° non-highschool sailing regattas and clinics from the [:calendar: SCYYRA calendar](http://www.scyyra.org/calendar/2019). The goal is to help inform and encourage our sailors of additional regattas they could sail.
