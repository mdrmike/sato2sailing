Sailing practice is **every** Wednesday and Friday @3:30p until 6:30p (or later), regardless of school schedule. For simplicity, practice days are not included on the calendar.

Our **Events Calendar** is based on [:calendar: PCISA Events Schedule](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/schedule/2018/2019/pcisa-s) for 2018-19 and [:calendar: Sato Holidays](https://sato-lbusd-ca.schoolloop.com/calendar). Add our calendar to your Google Calendar by clicking the icon at the bottom right. Alternatively, copy events one at a time by clicking on an event and choose "copy to my calendar."
