Our fall semester ends this month, and we're about to start spring semester. Here's a short list of things to be working on as we move forward.

-   **$600 Spring Tuition is due.** ABYC hosts the High School Sailing program.  The tuition fee is per semester and covers costs of all shared equipment; boats, sails, rigging, and trailers (for away regattas). The tuition also covers the cost for a professional coach for practices as well as most regattas, plus use of ABYC facilities to review video and have strategy "chalk talks."  All coaches are US Sailing Level 1 (minimum), AED, CPR, and First Aid certified.

-   **Fund raising.**  A good way to reduce costs and pay for team products such as [custom regatta pinnies](http://www.zimsailing.com/pinnies.html), [team jackets]() (useful as outerwear and spirit wear on campus), 

-   **Cold Weather Apparel.**  Get some layers now.  In So Cal sailing is usually beautiful and warm, and this year has been exceptionally warm and dry.... but the next 3-4 months will likely bring some cold chills.  If not dressed appropriate for conditions, sailing won't be fun.

-   **Sailing Improvement.** If you're looking to improve competitiveness at regattas, read a book about sailing racing skills and strategies, or search Youtube for come combination of sailing strategies, howto, tactics, learning, racing, etc.  We also have a [Youtube sailing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBIVF-v5OCLXge9au9hTLFcZXQ4UdEpxw).

-   **Cold Weather Regattas.** Be prepared for cold water and wind at regattas. Bring water wicking internal layers and clothing changes.
