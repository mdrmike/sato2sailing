Our fall semester ends this month, and we're about to start spring semester. Here's a short list of things to be working on as we move forward.

-   [$600 Spring Tuition is due (click)](https://abyc.org/high-school-sailing/high-school/spring-highschool-sailing-registration). ABYC hosts the High School Sailing program.  The tuition fee is per semester and covers costs of all shared equipment; boats, sails, rigging, and trailers (for away regattas). The tuition also covers the cost for a professional coach for practices as well as most regattas, plus use of ABYC facilities to review video and have strategy "chalk talks."  All coaches are US Sailing Level 1 (minimum), AED, CPR, and First Aid certified.

-   **Fund raising.**  For fund-raising events, we need family and friend involvement to help spread the word about events. Let's make it fun! Why Fund raise? It's a good way to reduce shared costs and pay for optional team products such as [custom team regatta pinnies](http://www.zimsailing.com/pinnies.html), [custom team jackets](https://www.google.com/search?q=sailing+mid+layer) (useful as mid layers and spirit wear on campus), [regatta tent](https://www.google.com/search?q=easy+up+10x10+tent&oq=easy+up+10x10), [inflateable furniture](https://www.google.com/search?q=inflatable+furniture), etc.

-   **Apparel.**  Get some layers now! Sailing in local waters is usually warm and beautiful, and this year has been exceptionally warm and dry.  But the next 3-4 months will likely bring much colder weather.  If sailors are not dressed appropriate for conditions, sailing not only won't be fun, it could be miserable.  See [our Gear & Apparel page](/apparel) for details.

-   **Cold Weather Regattas.** Be prepared for cold water and wind at regattas. Wear a skin tight _water wicking_ base layer, fleece/wool/synthetic mid layer(s), and a waterproof splash jacket.  Plus clothing changes!

-   **Sailing Improvement.** If you're looking to improve competitiveness at regattas, read a book about sailing racing skills and strategies, or search Youtube for come combination of sailing strategies, howto, tactics, learning, racing, etc.  We also have a [Youtube sailing playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBIVF-v5OCLXge9au9hTLFcZXQ4UdEpxw).
