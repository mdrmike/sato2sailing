Get ready to sail in November!  The first two weekends both have fun local regattas.  Saturday Nov 4 is SoCal #2: a one day regatta at BHYC, in Newport.  The following weekend Nov 11-12 is PCISA Anteater regatta: a two day regatta across the bay at NHYC.

## How to Confirm Regatta Participation

:sailboat: Want to sail?  Use this link to [Confirm Regatta Participation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHoOhTO7lkORibwT8FhTadlphJCcX4fGAcO9u2BuH8pL3XeA/viewform) for a sailor on the team.  This link allows you to confirm your intent to attend *these and any upcoming regattas*.  We'll handle the rest.

**Please note:** Regattas have additional fees.  We'll bill you once the Sato Sailing bank account is setup.

Finally, don't forget to check [old news](/#news) regarding weekend practices and fund-raising (It was titled News & Upcoming events).
