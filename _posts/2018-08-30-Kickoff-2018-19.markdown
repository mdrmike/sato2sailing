## First Practice

We had our first day of practice of 2018-19 season on Wednesday, Sep 5 afterschool 3-6:30p (some practices go later). The wind was fairly heavy, but made for good fun practice! **Friday is swim test.**

As always we recommend:

-   Bring an after-school snack
-   Bring a towel
-   Wear [appropriate gear](/apparel/)
-   and a change of sailing clothes can also be nice to have, especially when the weather is colder!
