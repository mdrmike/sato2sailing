## 2019 Sato Sailing Club Review

Sato continued to improve in their second year as a team. We lost a couple sailors Dextin '19, Elisabeth '21, and Owen '21 from our first year. But this year we welcomed new sailors Libby '19, Nate '21, Tyler '21, and Laura '22 who joined our existing team comprised of Elissa '19, Troy '20, Diego '21, Nikhil '21, Obi '21. Coach Nick McCabe was our primary coach through SoCal3, after which Craig Ramsay coached at regattas and practice with help from coach Allie.

Below you can find a breakdown of our season results for each event by skipper/crew and coach.

### 2018-19 Results Breakdown by Skipper / Crew

Sato team rankings improved in our second year, finishing 25 out of 57 PCISA High School teams overall. In addition, PCISA was one of the most competitive divisions this season, [winning three of four National Championship races](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/news-results/full-post/awesome-season-end). Point Loma HS won ISSA Mallory Dinghy, and ISSA Baker Team Racing National Championships. In the fall of 2018, Newport Harbor won the Cressy Full Rig. PCISA is one of seven districts. MASSA and SAISA also were very competitive this year in nationals.

Read below for details on how we improved together as a team.  Note, teams that won at nationals also practiced in healthy competitive environments in San Diego and Newport. Its great to see Long Beach teams competing against each other in practice.

#### Socal Series

The SoCal series is aimed at helping newer sailors master the flow of competition. Similar to practice but more formal, it allows for real world competition without real-time coach interaction... sailors must leanr to be independent, know the rules, understand strategy, and situational tactics. The SoCal series is a more relaxed environment than PCISA "Big 5" events, and also allows more time in the boat for skipper and crew to learn to work together.

#### Big5 PCISA Team Events

PCISA Team events are hosted by ISSA College teams in California. Many college teams provide opportunities for sailors to tour campus and team facilities before these regattas. Be sure to read the Notice of Race (NOR) or reach out to teams ahead of time to make arrangements. Before applying to colleges in the fall of Senior year, it can be especially helpful for Sophomore and Junior high school sailors to get a sense of college campus environments and opportunities to interact with college students during these visits.
