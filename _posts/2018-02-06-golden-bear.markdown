Are you ready to sail in the cold waters of San Francisco Bay?  It's winter and there's a potential it'll even be raining. [Golden Bear](https://hssailing.org/schedule_news/docs/pcisa_docs/2018-GOLDEN-BEAR-NOR.pdf) is in three weeks.  [Get sailing apparel](/apparel/) now, and be prepared to layer, stay dry, and stay warm! (Bring a change of clothes in case of capsize or rain).

The [PCISA Golden Bear Regatta](https://hssailing.org/schedule_news/docs/pcisa_docs/2018-GOLDEN-BEAR-NOR.pdf) is hosted by [Treasure Island Sailing Center](https://www.tisailing.org/) [Map of TISC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Treasure+Island+Sailing+Center/@37.8160056,-122.3658273,15z/) [Directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/33.8086316,-118.124807/Treasure+Island+Sailing+Center,+698+California+Ave+%23+112,+San+Francisco,+CA+94130/@35.7974095,-122.5093203,7z/).
News is some of the team will fly up, some driving. Communicate and coordinate now!

**Lodging:**  We'll mostly be on our own, but it'd be nice to coordinate a team dinner on Friday or Saturday, and hopefully include other ABYC teams (Wilson/Poly/HB). Many of us have family, but if you're not sure where you want to stay, Nikhil & Diego likely staying in the East Bay near Oakland/Berkeley.  Others will be in SF area.   

More info coming soon!

* Reminder, if you haven't paid spring semester, [read details here](/regatta/socal/SoCal-no3-preparation /).
