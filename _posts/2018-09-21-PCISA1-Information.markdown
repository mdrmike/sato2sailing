### Planning for PCISA1: Sea Otter

Parents, lets coordinate travel. We might have extra kids or coming along hoping to learn and maybe even rotate. The car that tows boats will take at 7 - 8 hours (max speed of 55mph).  At a minimum we'll need to leave after school on Friday. Kids will need to hit the road right after the regatta on Sunday. It'll be a rush on both sides to get on the road with boats.

There is an opportunity to leave early or stay late if anyone wants to tour Monterey Bay and/or Cal State Monterey Bay. This is especially true of upcoming PCISA Big5 events where colleges often host tours and practices on the Friday beforehand.

more details comeing soon... in the meantime, please share ideas in our planning folder (see sidebar)
