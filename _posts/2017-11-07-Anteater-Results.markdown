Sato Sailing's first PCISA Regatta was great!  We had fun even though wind was non-existent on Sunday!  Overall we placed really well in some races but not as well in others, and generally learned a lot about how the regatta is more structured than the Socal series.


### Participation

- **Team A:**  Nikhil Stewart, Diego Lockyer
