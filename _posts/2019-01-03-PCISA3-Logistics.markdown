Important Regatta Documents have been published and are attached as well as posted on the Official Regatta Websites (See Links Below).
Please read all these documents carefully and distribute to all relevant participants. With well over 600 sailors and coaches plus many others there are a lot of logistics.

A few notes:

-   Check out the Rose Bowl Maps. There are 3 Aerial Views (Scroll Down) that make understanding the venues much easier.
-   Appendix C - Important Information is vital logistics info. Read carefully BEFORE arrival and share info with all participants.
-   As always please prepare your boats carefully! They will be inspected before racing and you could be denied participation if your boat is sub-standard.
-   Out-of-State Teams (Using Charter Boats) need to email me TODAY with detailed plans (Arrival Time - After 1pm) if you wish to practice on Friday.
-   You can still purchase extra tickets for Saturday Dinner at:  https://hssailing.org/machform/view.php?id=102523
