## Wind & Weather Forecasts

**Sun March 3:** Forecast is cold, but mostly sunny, with chance of rain on Sunday. The biggest changes appear to be changes in tide direction each day, and wave frequency (half speed on Sunday).

#### Let's Track Actual Weather to Forecast Models

-    **ECMWF**  (EU) Very accurate model provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Clear winner compared to other forecast models. Since the model is commercial, only few companies in the World offer it.  
-    **GFS** (NOAA) Basic free model provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with not so good resolution. Compared to other models GFS can fail in mountain areas, and by forecasting clouds and precipitation. Since the model is free, majority of weather applications use GFS.  
-    **NAM** (NOAA)  Regional mesoscale model run by NCEP. Provides better resolution than global models.  
-    **NEMS** (SWISS/NOAA)  Very accurate model developed by NOAA, but improved and computed by Swiss Meteoblue. Excels in all parameters especially in Alpine areas.  


### Planning

Please register to help us get a headcount. Then reach out with ideas... maybe we can try to arrange room/group discount at a hotel, and plan some activities.  **All help in organizing, adding additional ideas, changes, etc. in our planning document/folder is encouraged!** Especially trip activity ideas! Let's make the most of it and have fun together!
