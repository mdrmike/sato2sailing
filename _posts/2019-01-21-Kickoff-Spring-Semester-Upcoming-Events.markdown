### SoCal #4 @ ABYC

High School Teams!  

As we get back into the swing of things here with our Spring Program, we have a ton of events lined up! One of those fantastic events is the SoCal Series Regatta 4 here at home and that means we need volunteers to help run the regatta. This regatta is both Saturday and Sunday (yes, on Super Bowl Sunday) so the more hands the faster we all get finished on Sunday.  

Once again, Allie has graciously agreed to be the PRO, and we know she will run a fantastic regatta!!! Make sure you are all here that weekend to thank her.  

**Parents:** This is a fantastic opportunity for you to help out and watch your sailors compete with the best viewing here in Long Beach! We will need help in a couple of key areas:
 - ***Registration*** - helping check in sailors and distributing bow numbers for all of the boats
 - ***Yard/Ramp duty*** - as teams arrive we need to make sure the yard is organized
 - ***Race Management*** - Allie will need help on both the starting boat as well as the finishing boat, very little or no experience is required so this is a fantastic time to learn!

**Sailors:** If you _are not actively competing_ in this regatta, you **MUST** help organize and run the regatta. All of our teams have an equal responsibility to help make this go smoothly, it is part of High School Sailing at ABYC. Email me with your preferred area of help if you are not racing.

Please [contact Craig (email here)](https://abyc.org/high-school-sailing/high-school), even with a preference of where you would like to pitch in, and I will assign you where we most need help!

### High School Spring Update

Hi everyone!
After discussions with multiple sailors and parents I have been able to make sure that Spring High School this year can offer a single day option!
I HIGHLY encourage sailors who can attend both days to do so, as it will allow the most time on the water, but if you can only attend one day to make the most out of your time, there is a Friday only option available.
Allie and I are working on making sure our travel regattas this Spring are planned well in advance and will be booking flights today for Golden Bear to get the least expensive flights we can.
I suggest that all teams do the same so they can reduce expenses as much as possible!!!
Please sign up for the Spring High School program as soon as possible so planning can continue based on our sailors' needs!

[Contact Craig (email/phone here)](https://abyc.org/high-school-sailing/high-school) if you have any questions
