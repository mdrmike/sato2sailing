Let's make the most of it and have fun together!

#### Activities and Ideas

Ideas and details need to be fleshed out. Please help. Go for it... and if you see something you have an idea on, use a "comment" in the document.  If you're not sure how, please reach out to Mike.  

**Examples:** _Lunch, Dinner, Touristy sightseeing not-to-be-missed stuff, College campus tours, etc._


##### TBD  

_More details about transportation, lodging, weather, after we get a headcount._
