### Results

We had a fantastic outing and our sailors demonstrated that working hard weekly is paying dividends. Everyone improved compared to others in their fleet, and all three of our boats finished in the top half of the fleet! Sato had finishes of 4, 6, as 12 (tie) of 26 boats in the fleet. [Full results](https://scores.hssailing.org/s18/2017-18-pcisa-socal-silver/) can be found on PCISA website.  We should mention local school LB Poly who we practice with finished 5th, which means ABYC coached four boats in the top 12!
