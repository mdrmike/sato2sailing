## Regatta Preparation & Equipment

If this is your first regatta you might want to read [ISSA Procedural Rules](https://hssailing.org/documents/procedural_rules17-20-a0917.pdf) which contains info regarding requirements for competitors, coaching, scoring, etc.  Also the [District Rules](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/documents/2017-18-PCISA-District-Rules.pdf) is an abbreviated version with modifications for the Pacific Coast District.

#### Equipment 

Of note for first time participants, each sailor must wear a US Coast Guard approved flotation device, aka Life Jacket.  Also, consider weather and water conditions when choosing clothing.
