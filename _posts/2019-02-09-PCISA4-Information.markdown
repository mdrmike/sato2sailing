#### PCISA4 Golden Bear at Treasure Island  

We're signed up for [:bear: Golden Bear Regatta](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/event/home/golden-bear/184) on Feb 22-23. Read the [Notice of Race (NOR)](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/documents/goldenbear19-nor.pdf) for regatta details. Last year there was college campus tour and practice with Cal sailing team the Friday beforehand. It's unclear if that is happening again this year, but watch here or PCISA for updates and we can travel early.

#### Practice for Cold Weather

**Feb 13** (Wed) is supposed to :umbrella: rain. It's a great opportunity for gear practice to ensure you're staying warm & dry in wet conditions. Being wet at a cold regatta is NOT fun. This week provides an opportunity to test your gear and potentially purchase more gear!  Not sure you have the right gear? We have an :shirt: [apparel](/apparel/) page!

#### Spring Sailing Tuition Due (Reminder)  

New! There are now two options for practice this semester. The recommended Wed+Friday practice for $700 -or- **Friday only** practice for $400. Please remit tuition ASAP.

### Viewing Area  

Coaches and spectators can view the racing from the shore west of the TISC gate. No persons shall go onto the rocks between the parking lot and the water for any reason whatsoever. This is not a protestable offense, although disciplinary action by the PCISA Board may result, at their discretion.
