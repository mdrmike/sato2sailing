## {{ page.title }}

Our first regatta of the season is Saturday Sep 14.  Then next is Oct 12-13.  Our complete schedule is on our [calendar](/calendar/) or you can always follow along on [PCISA website](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/schedule-results/2019/2020/pcisa-s). We've arranged coaching from Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club (CBYC). Be sure to Thank Coach Alex Smith, and McBride parent Aaron Feves, who has helped connect us with a coach for the weekend. Regattas in the future require sign-up commitment much sooner. Regattas in the future require sign-up commitment 2-3 weeks in advance. So also plan to let us know if you'll be traveling to Sea Otter in Monterrey. (It's one of the coolest regattas of the year).

## NHYC Hosts SoCal1

The SoCal series kicks off at our host Newport Harbor Yacht Club. The SoCal series consists of five events and is geared for new clubs and sailors like Sato Sailing. These events are where we learn to apply sailing skills with racing rules and have fun competing with other Southern California schools.

Are you feeling a little rusty or maybe a little unsure of your skills? Build some confidence and learn more by watching the videos we've shared! (link in sidebar)

### Regatta Schedule

There's typically 1-2 Regatta's per month. One in September. One in October. About half the Regatta's are one day, the others are full weekends of sailing. Check our [calendar](/calendar/) (and subscribe to it). The Regatta schedule aligns to Sato school breaks pretty well. More info about how it works coming soon.

### Preparation

In the meantime, be sure you're ready:

-   Are you signed on the team? Please double check [Sign-up (3-steps!)](/about/)
-   Come prepared to practice
    -   Bring a Towel
    -   Bring / wear [required sailing gear](/apparel/)
    -   Bring an after-school snack
    -   Change of clothes (especially important in winter months)
-   Are you signed up on the carpool? (this also means parents)
-   Let us know if you're planning to participate in SoCal1 on Friday. Normally we'll have a sign-up link, but for the first regatta, lets coordinate in person. Check the roster for contact info.

## Regatta Coordination: SoCal1

Right now, we need to know who's planning to attend. More info about the regatta and how the magic happens ... coming soon!
