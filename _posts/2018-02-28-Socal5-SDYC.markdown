More details forthcoming, but please (_please_, **please**) [:triangular_flag_on_post: sign-up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHoOhTO7lkORibwT8FhTadlphJCcX4fGAcO9u2BuH8pL3XeA/viewform) today (right now, even... just click) **even if you're not attending.**  It helps with planning and budget.

## Update #1

Depending on our need to tow boats to the regatta (or if we charter from the club), a few of us will be traveling down either Friday after school or Saturday (really, really, early) so we'll arive in time for 9:00a check-in. Please see the SoCal5 Planning folder (navigation bar).
