## Regatta Info

This is it! The last official HSS regatta of the year. This regatta is hosted by [San Diego Yacht Club (SDYC)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Diego+Yacht+Club/@32.7188262,-117.2295806,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb32271e0380bbf75!8m2!3d32.7188262!4d-117.2295806) near dowtown and north of Coronado Island.  Please [:triangular_flag_on_post: sign-up now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHoOhTO7lkORibwT8FhTadlphJCcX4fGAcO9u2BuH8pL3XeA/viewform) for SDYC SoCal5.  

More details forthcoming, but please (_please_, **please**) [:triangular_flag_on_post: sign-up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHoOhTO7lkORibwT8FhTadlphJCcX4fGAcO9u2BuH8pL3XeA/viewform) today (right now, even... just click) **even if you're not attending.**  It helps with planning and budget.

## Update #1

Depending on our need to tow boats to the regatta (or if we charter from the club), a few of us will be traveling down either Friday after school or Saturday (really, really, early) so we'll arive in time for 9:00a check-in. Please see the SoCal5 Planning folder (navigation bar).
