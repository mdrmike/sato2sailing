## Update #2

Greetings PCISA Silver Fleet Pacific Coast Championship competitors! We are very excited about having a record 30 teams competing this weekend! Here are a couple details which we hope will help.


#### Sailing Instructions

Sailing Instructions for the weekend: [SAILING INSTRUCTIONS](https://scores.hssailing.org/s18/pcisa-silver-pcc/notices/sailing-instructions.pdf)


#### Rotations

The rotations can be found on the techscore site for Silver PCCs. Please keep in mind we are using sail numbers 30-61 (with the exception of sails 39 and 47): [SILVER PCC ROTATIONS](https://scores.hssailing.org/s18/pcisa-silver-pcc/rotations/)


#### Scores

Racing Scores will be posted via the techscore website: [SCORES](https://scores.hssailing.org/s18/pcisa-silver-pcc/)


#### Food During Regatta

As stated in the NOR, each team will receive 4 breakfasts, lunches, dinner (Sat) in addition to the extras they purchased online. We will be selling extra lunches ($5) and Sat. dinner ($10) onsite. There will also be food available for purchase from the yacht club. Please help us be respectful of our members and not bring any outside food to the upper deck of the yacht club.  


#### Tee Shirts

As stated in the NOR, each team will receive one tee shirt per sailor registered. Limited quantities of tee shirts will be available for sale ($20/shirt) at registration.


#### Parking/Trailers

Please park all trailers on the grass area with shipping containers that is adjacent to the yacht club. Please be efficient with how theyâ€™re parked so that everyone may fit. Please avoid parking in the hotel or apartment building lots.


#### Friday Practice

Many of you are planning on getting in some practice time here at Encinal YC on Friday, April 20 before the event begins the next morning. We are more than happy to facilitate this, but want to make sure you have a few key pieces of information. EYC practice sails will be available for use if needed.


Teams may practice at any time between 100pm - 530pm.


All teams must check in with me (Mike) before hitting the water - EYC is also holding a Friday Night beer can race, so we may be asked to stay in a specific sailing area.


We will have one dedicated safety boat for this practice that all coaches will have to share if they choose to be on the water on Friday.

Registration for this regatta includes a t-shirt.  Also alternate sailors cost an extra $40 ea. Please help us plan. If you'd like to travel with us but not sail, that's okay too, especially in the event that someone falls ill last minute. It's good to have a prepared back-up.  No pressure, but please sign-up and **let us know by Mar 25.**</li><li>
