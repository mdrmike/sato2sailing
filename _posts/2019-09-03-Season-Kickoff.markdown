### About Sato Sailing

Sailing is more than just a fun & relaxing way to relieve homework stress. Yes, sailing in the sunny (mostly warm) waters in SoCal is amazing, but did you know sailing is an Olympic sport? In 2028 Long Beach will be host to sailing races for the Olympics in Los Angeles. Importantly for Sato students, Sailing is also a varsity/club sport at many Colleges. Sato Sailing club races in PCISA events, the same organization that runs college sailing. The Rosebowl Regatta hosted by USC, offers the opportunity to race & meet with college teams from throughout the country. in January 2019 there were representatives from over 40 colleges!


Sailing teaches independence, turning a plan into action, and adjusting to real world changes in real time. Sailing as a team requires cooperation, and rewards clear communication, strategy, preparation, and learning to anticipate changes. Much of our everyday communication related to navigation owes its roots to centuries of sailing, and transfers well to aerospace and rocketry. Many elements of engineering are applied in sailing, such as physics, [fluid dynamics](https://phys.org/news/2014-11-explore-unsteady-fluid-dynamics.html), [aerodynamics](http://web.mit.edu/2.972/www/reports/sail_boat/sail_boat.html), and [hydro dynamics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812016232), etc.
