### Gaucho Regatta Details  

Beyond being prepared for weather this weekend, please be reminded of the following based on email from UCSB sailing:

##### Gaucho Reminders  {#parking-etc}

Hello Gaucho competitors, coaches, and parents. We are excited as always to have you all be a part of this year’s Gaucho Regatta.  I want to remind all of you of some important information regarding this coming weekend’s event.

Before the regatta begins, on Friday, March 6th the UCSB Sailing Team members will be hosting guided campus tours and there will be a meet and greet with the coaching staff at 3:45-4:15pm on Friday.  Information and sign up for tour times is available at https://forms.gle/yDBtesE5uWXwtcAV7 or http://ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/gaucho-regatta.

Four shirts are already included with every registration, but if you would like to purchase more, you can do so at the event.  We will also have our annual BBQ with burgers (including veggie burgers) and hot dogs.  The sale of these items goes directly to the UCSB Sailing Team and supports their continual competitive rise.  If you would like to support the team through a tax-deductible charitable gift, you can learn more at http://www.ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/contribute.

There are still a few charter boats left. Please just send an email to ucsbsailingcoach@gmail.com if you are in need of a charter FJ.  All charter boats are pre-inspected for quick sail assignment and are located with easy launching from the UCSB dock right next to the launch ramp.

Please pass along the following information to your team members, coaches, and advisors:

1.       **Parking** – There are several rules for the parking lot that need to be taken into account. Please review this map carefully to avoid harbor tickets! The :memo: **Gaucho Regatta Map** is also on the event page at [http://www.ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/gaucho-regatta/](http://www.ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/gaucho-regatta/).    [![parking](/assets/posts/2018-19/pcisa5/2016-Gaucho-Parking-Map.jpg)](https://scores.hssailing.org/s20/pcisa-gaucho-silver/notices/parking-map.pdf)
2.       **Check-in:** When you arrive, visit the check-in table (noted on the **Gaucho Regatta Map**) to receive your t-shirts and Boat Inspection Forms necessary to get your sail assignments.  Chartering Teams may turn their paperwork and checks in this time if they still need to.
3.       **Boat Check:** Once you have your Boat Inspection Form, find a Gaucho with a flower lei on. Those Gauchos will be allowed to inspect and approve your team’s boat and will sign off on the inspection form.  Chartered boats are pre-inspected and may go to get their sails immediately after check in.
4.       **Sail Assignments:** Take the signed off inspection form to the Sail Assignment Station as shown on the Gaucho Regatta Map so that you can get your sail assignments.
5.       **T-shirts:** Many teams are not sure what sizes they wanted for their t-shirts when registering online.  In most cases, we put four shirts in your bag, however it is not a problem to exchange sizes!  Once you receive your shirts and realize you do not have the correct size, visit the check-in tent to exchange sizes.  Additional T-shirts will be for sale for $15 for the duration of the regatta.
6.       **Online Info:**  Sailing Instructions, Rotations, and Results will all be available online at [scores.hssailing.org](http://scores.hssailing.org).  Record of Participation (RP) can be filled out online at [ts.hssailing.org](http://ts.hssailing.org). There are no paper versions.  An amended course chart has been posted on techscore!  Please review the [course chart](https://scores.hssailing.org/s20/pcisa-gaucho-gold/notices/sailing-instructions-with-amended-course-chart.pdf) now and download to your phone for easy access

7.       **BBQ Tent / Central Command:** Will be located near the rotation area which will be announced at the competitor meeting.  This is where protest forms will be located and protest times and parties to the hearings will be posted.  There will also be burgers, hot dogs, snacks, and drinks for sale along with Gaucho merchandise at this location.  _We will be emptying the trash containers continually during the day, **so if you see a container nearly full**, please let the volunteers at the BBQ tent know so they can empty the trash containers._  
8.       **Weather:** Santa Barbara is a cold water, open ocean environment and it is crucial to come prepared with the proper gear!  The conditions can also be highly variable and a great deal of consideration should be given by each sailor and their coach on whether a sailor should go out on the water or not.  When in doubt, sit it out!
9.       **Recruits:** If you are interested in sailing on the UCSB Sailing Team one day, please contact coach, Brad Schaupeter or fill out the recruit form online at [http://ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/high-school-recruits/]http://ucsbsailing.squarespace.com/high-school-recruits/). We look forward to seeing many of you at our recruit session and campus tour.  If you haven’t signed up yet and still want to join, please feel free to show up at the **UCSB dock at 3:45pm on Friday** and/or the campus tour at 5pm.
10.  **Rotations:** Look for one more email Friday evening before the regatta regarding pop-up tents and rotation area.

As always, we are excited to see you all this weekend at the Gaucho.  We hope you enjoy the regatta and your visit to Santa Barbara.  

Best of luck this weekend!

## Wind & Weather Forecasts

**Sat March 4:** Forecast is cold, but mostly sunny, with chance of rain on Sunday. The biggest changes appear to be changes in tide direction each day, and wave frequency (half speed on Sunday).

#### Let's Track Actual Weather to Forecast Models

-    **ECMWF**  (EU) Very accurate model provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Clear winner compared to other forecast models. Since the model is commercial, only few companies in the World offer it.  
-    **GFS** (NOAA) Basic free model provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with not so good resolution. Compared to other models GFS can fail in mountain areas, and by forecasting clouds and precipitation. Since the model is free, majority of weather applications use GFS.  
-    **NAM** (NOAA)  Regional mesoscale model run by NCEP. Provides better resolution than global models.  
-    **NEMS** (SWISS/NOAA)  Very accurate model developed by NOAA, but improved and computed by Swiss Meteoblue. Excels in all parameters especially in Alpine areas.
