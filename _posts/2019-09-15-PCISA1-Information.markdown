## Amazing Season Start

If you're interested in sailing, reach out to us at school (we meet Tuesday's in Ms Saeed's room), our [Facebook Page], or on [Instagram]. We welcome anyone interested in sailing and willing to work at learning more about how sailing works. We're a fun welcoming club and we're off to a great start to our season in our first regatta! Two of our boats tied for first place in silver division, with a total of only 15 points each. With six races scored, that meant both boats averaged 2½ place finish. Scoring rules meant that _Nikhil Stewart (junior) & Tyler Hoang (junior)_ received the first place trophy due to the "Number of high-place (1st) finishes" over _Preston Woodworth (freshman) & Diego Lockyer (junior)._  But in the end both teams finished with trophy's and happy with their performance.

The third place boat was also from Long Beach, with 26 points, from Long Beach Wilson. Also of note, our borrowed coach, Alex Smith (CBYC), had five of the top six boats in the fleet of 17!

Third year sailor Troy Davidson skippered Sato's third boat and finished mid fleet with 12th overall. Troy was helped by new sailors Eli & Enzo rotating between races as his crew. The light wind of the day provided no favors for some of our largest sailors, which surely slowed them down compared to the <85lb eighth graders that came in third place. However, our new sailors will be indispensable and provide us balance in heavier winds.


### About Socal1   

The day felt much hotter than 84°F recorded high temperature. This reflects the very light winds of the day, only 2-3MPH with gusts 4-9MPH most of the day. By 3:00p wind died to 1MPH with very occasional gusts only 3-4. With forecast to remain stagnant, the officials boat called the day early.

### First Sailing Practice at ABYC

Practice starts this week. Before you can practice, you must fill-out and turn-in ABYC Medical and Sailing Sign-up form. It was handed out at the Parent Meeting at ABYC on Wed 9/11. Alternatively, download, print, and fill-out the [Registration Packet][Register].

Friday 9/20 is the first day of practice at [ABYC (map)][ABYC]. Then, practice will be every Wednesday and Fridays after school until daylight savings ends. Full schedule will be on our [calendar](/calendar/). Let's coordinate carpooling!


## PCISA1: Sea Otter in Monterey Bay

<!--more-->
Looking forward, our next regatta requires travel and planning. Oct 12-13 is PCISA1 is hosted by Cal State University of Monterey Bay at [Monterey Peninsula Yacht Club]({{ page.map }}). We need at least five sailors to commit before we can register, but we need to register soon, as fall regattas are limited in space and can fill-up.
