### Email from Coach Nick

    Hello everybody,

    Our second SoCal is here already! Time flies. Lets all get ready to show SoCal what our HS teams have to offer! This is a one day regatta taking place on 11/3/18. We will be sailing out of Bahia Corinthian Yacht (BCYC) located in Corona Del Mar CA. This is a perfect practice opportunity seeing as the following weekend is PCISA 2 at Newport Harbor Yacht Club just around the harbor.

    This venue offers a nice sailing venue very similar to the one ABYC offers inside of the bay. Calm protected waters and medium to light breeze. I expect to see the wind in the sub 10's with the temp around the 70's. Make sure sailors come with plenty of water and food. We will not be coming in half way through the day and are expecting to stay out all day.

    My goal is to have as much of our team attend this regatta seeing as there is no lodging involved and is a fairly easy commute. I also wish to leave our FJ trailer down south for the following weekends regatta at NHYC. I have communicated with BCYC and we can leave our trailer there. I am awaiting  response from NHYC to see if we will be allowed to bring our trailer over immediately following the SoCal. As for now lets bank on leaving it at BCYC. Sails, rudders and tillers will all be coming home regardless after the SoCal.
