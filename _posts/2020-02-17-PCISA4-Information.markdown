#### PCISA4 Golden Bear at Treasure Island  

[:bear: Golden Bear Regatta](https://pcisa.hssailing.org/schedule-results/details/pcisa-4-5-golden-bear-19) is a travel regatta on Feb 22-23. Golden Bear 2020 marks the first "Big Five" regatta that Sato Sailing is competing within the Gold Division. As a bit of background, Golden Bear is the fourth out of five "Big Five" PCISA regatta events that make up a full season of High School Sailing. It's also worth noting that each of the "Big Five" events are fleet racing regattas in which a minimum of four sailors compete together as a pair of skippers and crew. Once a sailor has skippered they may not crew. And crew may only switch to another boat a single time. The rules are more stringent than "SoCal" or "club sailing" events with the goal to create a fair competition between teams. Between races teams rotate boats and skipper/crew combination. The format and rules try to create fairness between teams so that boats, or equipment, or specific personnel on a team aren't favored and ultimately don't affect results.


 PCISA has some of the strongest sailors in the country. This should be a highly competitive regatta for Sato. Read the [Notice of Race (NOR)](https://hssailing.org/schedule_news/docs/pcisa_docs/2020-Golden-Bear-Regatta-NOR.pdf) for regatta details. Each year we make the trip to NorCal we have the opportunity to tour UC Cal Berkeley and in years past the sailing team hosts a personal tour as well as an opportunity to practice with them the Friday beforehand.
