- :information_source: SoCal3 is in San Diego. This is a fun trip in a great location. I suggest we find a hotel near [SWYC/Bali Hai restaraunt](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Bay+Club+Hotel+%26+Marina/@32.7167776,-117.2220582,15.5z/data=!4m19!1m8!2m7!1shotel+near+SDYC!5m5!5m4!1s2019-12-13!2i2!4m1!1i2!3m9!1s0x0:0xc51dbd1b7cbbc759!5m4!1s2019-12-13!2i2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d32.7159845!4d-117.2245637) for Saturday night, though I'll likely tow down Friday night too.  Let's coordinate options ASAP. The spectator viewing is great, and there's tons of things to do near SWYC/SDYC.
