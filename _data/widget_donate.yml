    Do you have a service or business you'd like to advertise? We have sponsorship opportunities! Sato ASB offers an opportunity to sponsor our team and buy either a 3x5' ($400), 4x6' ($600), or 6x10' ($1000) banner. It is hung on the fence at the school for up to a year!

    Sato doesn't have sports teams. To make matters worse, even if Sato did pay for sports, sailing is not a [CIF sport](http://www.cifstate.org/navbar-sports) and still wouldn't have school funding, even though it's an Olympic sport and many Colleges have sailing teams.
