    <h4>Using Shared Folder</h4> If you're accessing our shared folder from your phone or tablet, everything works using a web browser on any device (and no accounts are required).  However, there is also an option to install the apps <em>Google Docs</em> and <em>Google Sheets</em> which may make it even easier to edit. They are unessesary, but it gives you more options.
